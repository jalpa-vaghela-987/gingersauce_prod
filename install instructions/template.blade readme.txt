Please see the attached PHP file. It is a Blade template file. You can learn more about Blade templates here: https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/blade

This file is rendered as HTML with the data from PDF, and then the HTML is rendered as PDF.

This file includes CSS and HTML code + a little bit of PHP for calculations, and Blade shortcodes for logic and loops.

Every page has it's own div with id = pageN, where N is page number. All pages should be wrapped in a container, and first page styles (CSS) should be set relatively to thic container (.gradient is container, .gradient #page1 â€“ is page 1 style). This is neccessary for dynamic previews of the brandbook themes in the wizard.

All the rest is just a simple HTML and CSS. Placing data to the right place. I would recommend to use this template a basis, just changing styles of the elements.
